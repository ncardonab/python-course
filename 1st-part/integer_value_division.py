# This one doesn't work because it need to have both the same type
# print('value' + 1)
# In order to do so we need to parse it using the format function
# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# print(f'your age is {age}')

# Integer value division
print(9 // 4)

# Operations are calculed based on PEMDAS
